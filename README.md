# Weather-Application
This is an Android app that can determine the user's current location and display the local weather forecast.

For this project, I created an Android location finder app that includes a weather report. The application can track the user's location and display their current location on a Google map with a marker. It can also show the user's current location's latitude and longitude, postal address, and current location's weather information. Additionally, it can display the user's current location's weather report in its entirety. I developed this application with the help of Android Studio.

# Technologies & Tools

Programming Language:
Java

IDE:
Android Studio

# Functional Requirements

The device's location should be recorded by the application and displayed on a Google map.
Should be able to get the location's address and show it.
An information window with the current temperature and weather description for the place should appear whenever the user clicks the current location marker.
A full weather report derived from the data given by the API should appear in another activity that spawns when the user selects the'show more' button in the information window.

A sufficiently comprehensive map should be displayed by the program to enable the user to locate their device. A Google Map is used to display the map. The level of accuracy needed will depend on the application's goals, but for the majority of applications, it is adequate if the program can pinpoint the user's location precisely enough to allow him to identify the street or building he is in.
